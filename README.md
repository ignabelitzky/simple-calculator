# Calculator
This is a simple calculator that can perform the following operations:
* Sum (+)
* Subtract (-)
* Division (/)
* Multiplication (*)
* Module (%)
  
## Getting Started
This simple calculater could be open with any C++ compiler. I create this software using Visual Studio Community 2019.

### Prerequisites
You only need a C++ Compiler.

### Running Source.cpp file
Just compile the "Source.cpp" file and do some inputs like:
* 1 + 5 + 8
* r = 5.8
* area = pi * r * r
* someVariable = ((2 + 5) * 7) % 3

The corresponding outputs will be
* 14
* 5.8
* 105.683
* 1
  
## Source
I extract the basic code from the book "The C++ Programming Language - 3rd Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup"
